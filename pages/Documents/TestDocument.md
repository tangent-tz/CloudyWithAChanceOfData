**Piracy** is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable goods. Those who conduct acts of piracy are called **pirates**, vessels used for piracy are **pirate ships**. The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the [Sea Peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples "Sea Peoples"), a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the [Aegean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_civilization "Aegean civilization") and [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean "Mediterranean") civilisations. Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy,<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> as well as for [privateering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privateer "Privateer") and [commerce raiding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_raiding "Commerce raiding").

Historic examples of such areas include the waters of [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar "Gibraltar"), the [Strait of Malacca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy_in_the_Strait_of_Malacca "Piracy in the Strait of Malacca"), [Madagascar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar "Madagascar"), the [Gulf of Aden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy_off_the_coast_of_Somalia "Piracy off the coast of Somalia"), and the [English Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel "English Channel"), whose geographic structures facilitated pirate attacks.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The term _piracy_ generally refers to maritime piracy, although the term has been generalized to refer to acts committed on land,<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> in the air, on [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace "Cyberspace"), and (in science fiction) outer space. Piracy usually excludes crimes committed by the perpetrator on their own vessel (e.g. theft), as well as [privateering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privateer "Privateer"), which implies [authorization by a state government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_marque "Letter of marque").

Piracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under [customary international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_international_law "Customary international law") and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states. [In the early 21st century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy_in_the_21st_century "Piracy in the 21st century"), seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue, with estimated worldwide losses of US$16Â billion per year in 2004,<sup id="cite_ref-foreignaffairs.org_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy#cite_note-foreignaffairs.org-5">[5]</a></sup> particularly in the waters between the [Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea") and Indian Ocean, off the [Somali coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy_off_the_coast_of_Somalia "Piracy off the coast of Somalia"), and also in the [Strait of Malacca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca "Strait of Malacca") and [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy_and_armed_robbery_in_the_Singapore_Strait "Piracy and armed robbery in the Singapore Strait"). Modern-day pirates are armed with automatic weapons, such as [assault rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle "Assault rifle"), and machine guns, [grenades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenade "Grenade") and [rocket propelled grenades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_propelled_grenade "Rocket propelled grenade"). They often use small motorboats to attack and board ships, a tactic that takes advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels and transport ships. The [international community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community "International community") is facing many challenges in bringing modern pirates to [justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice "Justice"), as these attacks often occur in [international waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters "International waters").<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Nations have used their [naval forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy "Navy") to repel and pursue pirates, and some private vessels use armed security guards, high-pressure [water cannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cannon "Water cannon"), or [sound cannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_cannon "Sound cannon") to repel boarders, and use [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar") to avoid potential threats.
